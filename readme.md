## Overview

**Project Title**: Target Practice Game

**Project Description**: 

This is a program I made using the python pygame library. The program is a game where the user is presented with a menu and can choose between a few different game modes to click objects and score points.

**Project Goals**: 

Get more accustomed to pygame, make my own assets, and have fun with programming.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install pygame by running 'pip install pygame'
2. Make sure you are in the same directory as the asset file, or else they will not load
3. Click run

Instructions for using the software:

1. You are presented with three options- freeplay, accuracy, and countdown mode. Freeplay allows you to play to the end and records your time, accuracy gives you a limited amount of clicks and records your score, and countdown gives you a limited amount of time and records your score.
2. If you need to restart the game, click restart and you will be returned to the main menu immediately. If you need to pause, click pause and then either return to the main menu or resume when you are ready.
3. You can choose to reset the high scores by clicking the option in the main menu. This will overwrite the .txt file with blank scores.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Install python
* Install pygame
* Make sure all assets are present

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
* [Duck Hunt Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2pd3KRSoHI&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add a weapon selection screen
* [ ] Compile into a single .exe file that can be ran
* [ ] Add a toggle sounds on/off button
